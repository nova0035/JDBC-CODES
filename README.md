# JDBC-CODES Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the JDBC-CODES repository! This repository contains a collection of Java code examples for performing various database operations using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). JDBC is a Java-based API that allows developers to interact with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.

These code examples serve as a reference for developers looking to work with databases in Java applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** You should have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an alternative such as OpenJDK.

- **Database:** You need access to a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and connection details.

- **JDBC Driver:** Download and include the JDBC driver specific to your database in your project. Most database vendors provide JDBC drivers that you can find on their official websites.

- **IDE:** You can use any Java-compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code for running these examples.
